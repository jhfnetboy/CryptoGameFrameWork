# CryptoGameFrameWork
Yeah, it is yet another(?) crypto game framework, that service for the Arcadia: Infinity Garden

## Motivation
We(CMUBA guys) want to create something running with a triangle: Community-->Game-->Business.
So the crypto game with tokens can help us to build this circle.
If you join a community with a game mode and contribute, get PNTs.
You can also play games with all community members to earn more PNTs to get a community reputation or game gear.
Or, you can use your PNTs to get gifts or giveaways from real business units or join activities in the real business to get PNTs.

## Destination
This repo will collect some Web3 SDK or repos to build a framework to help us build a Crypto game in one week!
Haha, it is also a Hackathon toolkit for all!
If you want to build a Crypto Game in a few days, try us and leave some feedback.

Build a quick flow with some SDK and codings for the Web3 part of the Crypto Games.
And you must finish the game's core part: story and run.
This repo can help you to get a Crypto engine maybe.
